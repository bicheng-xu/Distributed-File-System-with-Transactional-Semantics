LOG Implementation:
There are two sorts of log file
- “.serverLog": record all transactions state before crash for server recovery. It will only be deleted when the Server exit using "Ctrl-C.

- "." + transactionId: one log file for each transaction, record all details of each transaction for server recovery. It will be deleted after that transaction being committed or abortted.
